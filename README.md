# Coding standards:
* Alphabetize all things
* * At top level, it's `mod` -> `pub use` -> `use` then rest of code
* * After that, it's `pub enum` -> `enum` -> `pub fn` -> `fn` -> `pub struct` -> `struct` -> `tests`
* * All `fn` params should be alphabetized
* * All `struct` props should be alphabetized
* * If `fn` prop count >= 5, use a struct
* Everything should be commented
* Tests should be modularized by `fn` name, then by inputs
